# CSS Fundamentals - Let's Style our Pages!

## What is CSS?

CSS (which stands for *cascading style sheets*) is ***the*** fundamental way of adding style to your websites. Without it, your sites are just a bunch of text in ugly chunks. All the color, style, and generally cool things you see on the web require tons of CSS. Today will be a nice starting point for you to get your feet wet and see some cool results.

## Follow Along
If you want to follow along, navigate to a existing HTML page (like your passion or hobby project) in the terminal.

## Applying CSS styling to an HTML Page
### Step 1: Create a CSS file
The first thing we need to do is create a css file that our html page can get its styling from. In your terminal or navigator, create a new file called `style.css`.

### Step 2:Link to your CSS file from your HTML page
We need to connect our `style.css` page to the HTML page. Inside the `<head>` tag of your html page, we're going to add a `<link>` tag to connect to our new stylesheet. Add the following element to your `<head>` section:

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

(make sure that your html page and your css stylesheet are at the same folder level)

### Step 3: Select and Style elements, by element
Try selecting an element and styling it! In your stylesheet type:
```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 25px;
}
```
This will look for all h1 elements and style them with a font size of 25 pixels, and blue color. Open up your webpage to check it out! Remember to save your style.css page or any changes to your HTML page before viewing the webpage.

## Good Starter Properties To Play With
  + color
  + font-size

  + width and height (for images)
  + text-align
  + border-color

  This is just a tiny little list to start playing with. Look for more in Resources or by Googling "CSS Properties list".

## A Note About Color
Color in CSS can be tackled a few different ways:
+ Using key words: There are 140 differnt color names which your web brower can make sense of--basically every crayon color you could want from "cornslik" to "rebeccapurple." You can find a [complete list of colors here](http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp).
+ Using Hex Codes: `#4286f4`, `#336034`, etc. You can find hex codes by using this cool [color picker tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool).
+ Using RGB: `rgb(255,0,0)`, `rgb(120,200,0)`, etc. RGB Stands for red, green blue. You can also use the [color picker tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool) to get rgb values (each value has to be between 0 and 255).
