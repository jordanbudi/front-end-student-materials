# Images

By now you have surely drawn your fair share of ellipses, rectangles and lines. Let's explore how to add images to the canvas in p5.js

### Step 1: File Structure

A small amount of setup will be required to display images on the canvas.

First, the images files will need a place to live in our project. Use the `mkdir` command to create a directory called `images`.

![mkdir images](https://s3.amazonaws.com/upperline/curriculum-assets/p5js/mkdir-images.gif)

In that folder you can put the image files you will be working with.

*You can right click the image below and save to your computer and then drag into cloud9. Make sure you save it as something easy to type and remember, try `cactus.jpg`*

### Step 2: Loading the Image

Just because the image-file is now in our project doesn't mean it's loaded into p5.  We want to tell p5 to load this image just before the `setup()` function is called so if we try to draw the image on the canvas, it's already loaded.

Think for a minute about an event like a mouse click.  At the moment the event happens, a function called `mouseClicked()` is triggered.  The same way that works, there is a function called `preload()` that is triggered exactly at the moment just before `setup()` is called. Let's add that function to some starter code that should otherwise look pretty familiar.

```javascript
function preload() {

}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  background(0);
}
```

Inside of `preload` we will need to load in our image and store it in a variable. Since we'll definitely need to use this variable later, let's make it a global variable that we assign a value to in `preload`.

To do this we will need to use a function called `loadImage` that takes an argument of the *path to file we want to load*.

Make sure you put the file path in quotes and have no typos.

The path for a file called `cactus.jpg` that is inside of a folder called `images` will be `"images/cactus.jpg"`

```javascript
var cactus;

function preload() {
  cactus = loadImage("images/cactus.jpg")
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {

}
```

### Step 3: Rendering the Image

The only thing left to do is to get this image onto the canvas. Let's draw one wherever we click the mouse.

The function we want to use is called `image`.

For arguments it takes the variable of the loaded image, and, like `rect`, the x and y coordinates of the top left corner.

Add in this function

```javascript
function mouseClicked() {
  image(cactus, mouseX, mouseY);
}
```

#### ðŸ””ðŸ”‘ðŸ’¡ Tip ðŸ’¡ðŸ”‘ðŸ””
> Perhaps you noticed that when a new cactus was added and it overlapped an old cactus you could see the white background rectangle surrounding it.  Images are rectangles, rows and columns of pixels. To have some of those pixels be translucent your image file would have to be in the .png format, a .jpg format cannot handle translucent pixels.  You'll actually see an example of .png files with translucent pixels below

## Mini-Challenges

### Challenge 1

![meerkat-hiding](https://s3.amazonaws.com/upperline/curriculum-assets/p5js/meerkat-hiding.gif)

Add these three images to you `images` folder to recreate the gif above.  

The meerkat should move with vertical movement of the mouse and the canvas size should be `800` by `400`

![meerkat](https://s3.amazonaws.com/upperline/curriculum-assets/p5js/meerkat.png)

![front-mound](https://s3.amazonaws.com/upperline/curriculum-assets/p5js/front-mound.png)

### Challenge 2

Take pictures of yourself looking straight ahead and in at least 2 other directions. When the appropriate arrow key is pressed your avatar should look in that direction. When no key is pressed you can go stare straight ahead

![look-around](https://s3.amazonaws.com/upperline/curriculum-assets/p5js/look-around.gif)

You could expand upon this idea by making yourself walk around in a room like a video game character.  

Find or take a picture of an empty room and use the arrow keys to make your character move around the screen.

As a bonus, use multiple images of yourself facing in different directions.
